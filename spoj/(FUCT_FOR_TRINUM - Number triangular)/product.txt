Enter any positive integer that describes the height of number triangular. Print out the number triangular.

Example
The number triangular that has 5 rows is:
1
2 1 
3 2 1
4 3 2 1
5 4 3 2 1

Input
Contain the height of number triangular.

Constraints
0 < n â‰¤ 100

Output
Print out the number triangular.




To solve this problem, we need to create a program that can print a number triangular with a given height. The number triangular is a pattern where each row contains numbers from the current row number down to 1.

We can start by getting the height of the number triangular from the input. Then, we can use a loop to iterate over each row of the triangular. In each row, we can use another loop to print the numbers from the current row number down to 1.

To print the numbers in the correct order, we can use a nested loop structure. The outer loop will iterate over each row, and the inner loop will iterate over each number in the row.

Let's start by writing the code to read the input and iterate over each row of the triangular.

Next step will be CODE to implement the solution.




#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = i; j >= 1; j--) {
            std::cout << j << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}




Let's examine a custom corner case, where n is its minimum value: n = 1.
1
In this case, the height of triangle is 1, so the shape of triangle will be as follows:
1
So, the answer for this test case will be "1".
