Astronaut Natasha arrived on Mars. She knows that the Martians are very poor aliens. To ensure a better life for the Mars citizens, their emperor decided to take tax from every tourist who visited the planet. Natasha is the inhabitant of Earth, therefore she had to pay the tax to enter the territory of Mars.

There are n banknote denominations on Mars: the value of i-th banknote is \(a_i\). Natasha has an infinite number of banknotes of each denomination.

Martians have k fingers on their hands, so they use a number system with base k. In addition, the Martians consider the digit d (in the number system with base k) divine. Thus, if the last digit in Natasha's tax amount written in the number system with the base k is d, the Martians will be happy. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know the Martians' divine digit yet.

Determine for which values d Natasha can make the Martians happy.

Natasha can use only her banknotes. Martians don't give her change.

<b>Input</b>
The first line contains two integers n and k (1≤n≤100000, 2≤k≤100000) — the number of denominations of banknotes and the base of the number system on Mars.

The second line contains n integers \(a_1,a_2,…,a_n (1≤a_i≤10^9)\) — denominations of banknotes on Mars.

All numbers are given in decimal notation.

<b>Output</b>
On the first line output the number of values d for which Natasha can make the Martians happy.

In the second line, output all these values in increasing order.

Print all numbers in decimal notation.

<b>Note</b>
Consider the first test case. It uses the octal number system.

If you take one banknote with the value of 12, you will get \(14_8\) in octal system. The last digit is \(4_8\).

If you take one banknote with the value of 12 and one banknote with the value of 20, the total value will be 32. In the octal system, it is \(40_8\). The last digit is \(0_8\).

If you take two banknotes with the value of 20, the total value will be 40, this is \(50_8\) in the octal system. The last digit is \(0_8\).

No other digits other than \(0_8\) and \(4_8\) can be obtained. Digits \(0_8\) and \(4_8\) could also be obtained in other ways.

The second test case uses the decimal number system. The nominals of all banknotes end with zero, so Natasha can give the Martians only the amount whose decimal notation also ends with zero.





The naive solution is to try all possible subsets of the given array, find the last digit of its sum in base k and insert it into a set, the answer will be this set, but this is too slow.

We can see that the last digit of \(x\) in base \(k\) is \((x \% k)\).
If we have two numbers \(a,b\).
Let \(g = GCD(a,b)\)
We know that \(g = ax + by\) for some integers \(x,y\)
The last digit of this term can be \(g \%k = (ax+by)\%k\)
So the smallest positive last digit of \(a+b\) in base \(k\) is \(GCD(a,b,k)\).

Now we can see that the answer is just 0 and the multiples \(GCD\) between \(k\) and the elements of the array and we're bounded with the value \(k\).





#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int gcd(int a, int b){
    if (b == 0)
        return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}

int main() {
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    int g = k;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x;
        cin >> x;
        g = gcd(g,x);
    }
    cout << k / g << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i += g) {
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}






Let's try a custom test when the gcd = 1
<code>
3 2
3 4 5
</code>
the expected output should be
<code>
0 1
</code>





3 2
3 4 5
