Problem Statement:
<b>Set of Points</b>
time limit per test: 2 seconds
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

Convexity of a set of points on the plane is the size of the largest subset of points that form a convex polygon. Your task is to build a set of \( n \) points with the convexity of exactly \( m \). Your set of points should not contain three points that lie on a straight line.

<b>Input</b>
The single line contains two integers \( n \) and \( m \) \( (3 \leq m \leq 100, m \leq n \leq 2m) \).

<b>Output</b>
If there is no solution, print "-1". Otherwise, print \( n \) pairs of integers â€” the coordinates of points of any set with the convexity of \( m \). The coordinates shouldn't exceed \( 10^8 \) in their absolute value.






The solution is very simple. We can take m points in any convex function and (n-m) points in any concave function such that the distance between the two functions is large enough to satisfy the condition of no three point lie on a straight line. Then, from those points, we can take the maximum m points to form a convex polygon because if we take more than m points, then the polygon will not be convex (at least one point will be taken from the concave function).
We can take the convex function as \(y = x^2 + 1000000\) (since the second derivative is positive) and the concave function as \(y = -x^2 - 1000000\) (since the second derivative is negative). Then, we can take the first m points from the convex function and the next n-m points from the concave function.

But there is a special case when m = 3. In this case:
1. if n = 3, then we can take the points (0,0), (3,0), (0,3) which form a triangle and the convexity is 3.
2. if n = 4, then we can take the points (0,0), (3,0), (0,3), (1,1). Here, the convexity is 3 because the points (0,0), (3,0), (0,3) form a triangle and the point (1,1) is strictly inside the triangle.
3. if n > 4, then it is not possible to form a convex polygon with convexity 3 because there will be at least 4 points that can form a convex. Then the convexity will be greater than 3. So, In this case, the answer is -1.





#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n,m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    return 0;
}





At first, I will handle the special case when m = 3 according to above discussion (in thinking block).





#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n,m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<pair<int,int>>res;
    if(m==3) {
        if(n>4) {
            cout << -1 << endl;
            return 0;
        }
        res.push_back({0,0});
        res.push_back({3,0});res.push_back({0,3});
        if(n==4) res.push_back({1,1});
        for(auto x:res) cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    return 0;
}





Then, I will implement a convex function and a concave function. The convex function take the value of x and return the value of y in the convex function \(y=x^2 + 1000000\). The concave function will also take the value of x and return the value of y in the concave function \(y=-x^2 - 1000000\).





#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int convexF(int x) {
    return x*x+1000000;
}
int concaveF(int x) {
    return -x*x-1000000;
}

int main() {
    int n,m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<pair<int,int>>res;
    if(m==3) {
        if(n>4) {
            cout << -1 << endl;
            return 0;
        }
        res.push_back({0,0});
        res.push_back({3,0});res.push_back({0,3});
        if(n==4) res.push_back({1,1});
        for(auto x:res) cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    return 0;
}





Then, I will iterate from 1 to n and take the first m points (for x=1...m) from the convex and the next n-m points (for x=(m+1)...n) from the concave function. Then, I will print the points.





#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int convexF(int x) {
    return x*x+1000000;
}
int concaveF(int x) {
    return -x*x-1000000;
}

int main() {
    int n,m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    vector<pair<int,int>>res;
    if(m==3) {
        if(n>4) {
            cout << -1 << endl;
            return 0;
        }
        res.push_back({0,0});
        res.push_back({3,0});res.push_back({0,3});
        if(n==4) res.push_back({1,1});
        for(auto x:res) cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++) {
        if(i<=m) res.push_back({i,convexF(i)});
        else res.push_back({i,concaveF(i)});
    }
    for(auto x:res) cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl;
    return 0;
}





Though this output is different from the sample output, it is also a valid answer (since any valid answer is acceptable in this problem). Now, check the validity:

<img 1>

If we plot these points on a graph, then we can see that all 6 points can form a convex polygon and no three points lie on a straight line. So, this output is also valid.





This output is also valid. Because, the first 4 points we got from the convex function \(y = x^2 + 1000000\) and last three point we got from concave function \(y=-x^2 - 1000000\). Therefore, The size of largest subset of point that form a convex polygon will be max(4,3)=4. And also there is no three points lie on a straight line. Therefore, it is valid.





All sample testcases are passed. Now, I will test the another edge case that is not covered in the sample testcases.
The edge case is when n = 5 and m = 3. The answer should be -1 because it is not possible to form a convex polygon with convexity 3 with 5 points. Because there will be at least 4 points that can form a convex polygon. So, the answer should be -1.

<b>Input</b>:
5 3
<b>Expected Output</b>:
-1

Let's test the code with this input.
