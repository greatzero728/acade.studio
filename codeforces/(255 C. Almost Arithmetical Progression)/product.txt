C. Almost Arithmetical Progression
time limit per test: 1 second
memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

Gena loves sequences of numbers. Recently, he has discovered a new type of sequences which he called an almost arithmetical progression. A sequence is an almost arithmetical progression, if its elements can be represented as:

\(\bullet\) \(a_1 = p\), where p is some integer;
\(\bullet\) \(a_i = a_{i - 1} + ( - 1)^{i + 1}·q (i > 1)\), where q is some integer.

Right now Gena has a piece of paper with sequence b, consisting of n integers. Help Gena, find there the longest subsequence of integers that is an almost arithmetical progression.

Sequence \(s_1,  s_2,  ...,  s_k\) is a subsequence of sequence \(b_1,  b_2,  ...,  b_n\), if there is such increasing sequence of indexes \(i_1, i_2, ..., i_k (1  ≤  i_1  <  i_2  < ...   <  i_k  ≤  n)\), that \(b_{i_j}  =  s_j\). In other words, sequence s can be obtained from b by crossing out some elements.

Input
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 4000). The next line contains n integers \(b_1, b_2..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6)\).

Output
Print a single integer — the length of the required longest subsequence.

Note
In the first test the sequence actually is the suitable subsequence.

In the second test the following subsequence fits: 10, 20, 10.
